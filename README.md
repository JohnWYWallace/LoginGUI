# LoginGUI
This is a project I presented in my programming 2 class. It is a simple GUI that logs you in if the username and password match in the hash map.

## What does the project do?
This project takes in a username and password and checks to see if they match and if and only if they match will they be granted access to the next screen.

## What I learned from this project?
I learned a lot in this project and at the time was the biggest project I did to date. It was so much fun creating and learned a whole lot.
I more specifically learned about Javas Javax Swing library to edit the Graphical User Interface. i Used alot of Jbuttons and JTextFields to make this project work and user friendly. I also used a LinkedList which at the time had no clue what exactly it was doing but managed to figure out how to use it.
The linked lost was used to store the customer info after successfully logging in. 

## This project in action!

### First after launching the application you are prompted with this screen. (Yes blue is my favorite color!)

### Next you will input the username and password and this is what happens if it does not match the hashmap.

### Now what you can do here after logging in is insert a ID number associated with a name and it will be added to the top of the screen with a email concatenated to the end of the name.
